# Code of Conduct

## Our Goal

We aim to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience
for everyone.

We aim to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Any conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
professional setting is unacceptable.

## Moderation

Community leaders should take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the ability to remove or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and should communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to @lsimons. Complaints will be reviewed and investigated.

## Enforcement Guidelines

the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:
